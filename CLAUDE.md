# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Language Preference

Please respond in Japanese (日本語) unless explicitly requested otherwise.

## Project Overview

This is a learning project for experimenting with Claude Code functionality. The repository serves as a sandbox for exploring Claude Code capabilities and testing various development workflows.

## Repository Structure

- `README.md` - Project overview in Japanese
- `CLAUDE.md` - This file with guidance for Claude Code
- `docs/` - Documentation folder for learning materials and notes

## Development Approach

This is an experimental learning repository with the following characteristics:

- **Incremental Learning**: New technologies and frameworks will be added as learning exercises
- **Documentation-First**: All experiments should be documented in the `docs/` folder
- **Flexible Structure**: The repository structure will evolve based on learning needs

## Git Guidelines

- Gitのコミットメッセージは日本語で作成する
- 学習内容に応じて適切なコミット粒度を保つ
- 実験的な変更は明確にコミットメッセージで示す

## Future Development Notes

As this is a learning repository, specific build processes, testing frameworks, and development workflows will be established when concrete projects are added. Always check for:

- Project-specific README files in subdirectories
- Configuration files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.) that indicate the technology stack
- Existing documentation in the `docs/` folder before starting new experiments
